# Blippi.gg
Hey everyone! I created blippi.gg so anyone that wanted to get into the video game Super Smash Bros. Melee could as quickly and as easily as possible. The Melee community is characterized by our vivacious enthusiasm and deep love for the game. During quarantine, we can't meet in-person to do tournaments, so we've turned to stay-at-home solutions to compete. 

A treasure trove of open source software has been made all for the love of this game - Slippi, a fork of the Dolphin Emulator, has been fine-tuned to recreate the console Melee experience with rollback netcode and includes match replay-saving features. Creator Fizzi quit his job and worked on this for 6 months before releasing it. Slippi is single-highhandedly keeping our competitive scene thriving. Supporting software like Clippi and Slippi Stats help us get the most out of our most hype matches. M'Overlay is software to display controller input and also control music playback for Slippi. And the Melee Stream Tool lets anyone who wants to stream Melee quickly and easily generate an overlay that can be updated dynamically and display information beautifully. These are just some examples of the amazing tools being developed for this game and its community.

Blippi.gg aims to be the go-to hub for the Super Smash Bros. Melee community. The site doubles as a destination for newcomers while also bringing all of the amazing fan-created software and resources together in one place. Additionally, the site has its own pages for a Melee Discord server directory, a list of codes to add cool features to the game, an app to show you're playing Melee on Discord and Steam, and also a full tutorial on how to rip your copy of the game as an ISO, among many other helpful resources. I'm planning on adding even more soon!

While Nintendo might not always be the most supportive of our grassroots community, we've taken the charge ourselves.

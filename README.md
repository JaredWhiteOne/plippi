# Plippi.gg
  
Plippi is Super Smash Bros. Brawl's alternative to [Blippi.gg](https://blippi.gg), a creation of [David V. Kimball](https://davidvkimball.com/). For more information Blippi, see its README [here](https://github.com/davidvkimball/blippi).  
  
## Goal
The ultimate goal of Plippi.gg is to be a complete parity of Blippi.gg for Brawl by providing an access point for all things SSBB related, from how to access its central community, play netplay in the modern era, successfully modify its contents, and so much more!
